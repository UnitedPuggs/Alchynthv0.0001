# Alchynthv0.0001
Game built from the ground up using Slick2D and OpenGL. Created by two optimistic AP CS students. A passion project inspired by the likes of Pokemon Mystery dungeon with a potion brewing twist. All current textures are placeholders and a move to Unity may happen in the future. https://alchynth.github.io/ - website dedicated to the game.
